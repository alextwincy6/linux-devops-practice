# Day 01 – Linux Basics 🐧

Today I started learning Linux basics for DevOps.  
Here are the key things I practiced:

---

## 🔹 Basic Commands
- `pwd` → Print working directory (where I am).  
- `ls` → List files and directories.  
- `ls -l` → Detailed list with permissions.  
- `ls -a` → Show hidden files.  
- `cd <folder>` → Change directory.  
- `cd ..` → Go back one folder.  
- `cd ~` → Go to home directory.  

---

## 🔹 File & Directory Operations
- `touch file.txt` → Create a new file.  
- `mkdir myfolder` → Create a new folder.  
- `cp file1.txt file2.txt` → Copy a file.  
- `mv file.txt myfolder/` → Move a file.  
- `rm file.txt` → Delete a file.  
- `rmdir foldername` → Remove an empty folder.  
- `rm -r foldername` → Remove folder with contents.  

---

## 🔹 Viewing Files
- `cat file.txt` → Show full content.  
- `less file.txt` → View file (scrollable).  
- `head file.txt` → Show first 10 lines.  
- `tail file.txt` → Show last 10 lines.  
- `tail -f logfile.log` → Watch logs in real time.
