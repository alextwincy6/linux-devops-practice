# Day 3: File Permissions, Ownership, and Groups Practice

## Objective:
Learn Linux file permissions, ownership, and groups commands.

### Step 1: Create a file
touch file1.txt
ls -l file1.txt
# Output shows default permissions and ownership

### Step 2: Change file permissions
chmod 700 file1.txt      # Owner can read/write/execute
chmod 654 file1.txt      # Owner: read/write, Group: read/execute, Others: read

### Step 3: Check file permissions
ls -l file1.txt
# Permissions are shown as: -rw-r-xr--

### Step 4: Change ownership
sudo chown alex_injeti file1.txt      # Change owner to alex_injeti
sudo chown alex_injeti:test_group file1.txt   # Change owner and group

### Step 5: Change group only
sudo chgrp test_group file1.txt

### Step 6: Verify owner and group
ls -l file1.txt
groups alex_injeti   # Show groups user belongs to

### Notes:
- `r` = read, `w` = write, `x` = execute
- File permissions: owner | group | others
- Groups allow multiple users to share access
- Use `sudo` if you need root privileges to change ownership
