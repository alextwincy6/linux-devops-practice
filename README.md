# Day 2: File Viewing and Editing Practice

**Objective:** Learn commands to view, read, and edit files in Linux.

## Commands Practiced
- `cat` â€“ view file content
- `less` â€“ scroll through long files (`q` to quit)
- `head -n <N>` â€“ show the first N lines
- `tail -n <N>` â€“ show the last N lines
- `tail -f` â€“ follow file updates in real time (`Ctrl+C` to quit)
- `nano` â€“ terminal editor (save with `Ctrl+O`, exit `Ctrl+X`)
- `wc` â€“ count lines/words/bytes (`wc -l`, `wc -w`)

## ðŸ“„ Example Practice

```bash
# Create folder for Day 2
mkdir -p devops_day2
cd devops_day2

# Create a practice file
nano day2_practice.txt
# Add content about Linux commands and practice notes
# Example content:
# Linux is a powerful operating system.
# It is widely used in servers and DevOps.
# Commands practiced today: cat, less, head, tail, nano, wc, pipes (|)

# Save and exit (Ctrl+O, Enter, Ctrl+X)

# View file content
cat day2_practice.txt
less day2_practice.txt
head -n 5 day2_practice.txt
tail -n 5 day2_practice.txt

# Follow updates live
tail -f day2_practice.txt

<<<<<<< HEAD
# Count lines, words, and bytes
wc day2_practice.txt
cat day2_practice.txt | wc -l
=======
# Remove a file
rm old_file.txt

#After praticing Linux commands , I pushed my learning to GitHub:

# Initialize Git repository
git init

# Check status
git status

# Add all files
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Add Day 1 Linux command practice"

# Rename branch to main
git branch -M main

# Add remote repository (SSH)
git remote add origin git@github.com:alextwincy6/linux-devops-practice.git

# Push changes to GitHub
git push -u origin main


#SSH Key Setup (for secure GitHub access):

ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "alextwincy6@gmail.com"
ssh -T git@github.com

#After this, I successfully pushed all my Day 1 practice to GitHub.

### **Day 2: File Viewing and Editing Practice**

**Objective:** Learn and practice commands to view, read, and edit files in the terminal.

#### ðŸ“‚ Commands Practiced
- `cat` â€“ view file content  
- `less` â€“ view long files page-by-page (`q` to quit)  
- `head -n <N>` â€“ show the first N lines  
- `tail -n <N>` â€“ show the last N lines  
- `tail -f` â€“ follow file updates in real time (quit with `Ctrl+C`)  
- `nano` â€“ simple terminal editor (save with `Ctrl+O`, exit `Ctrl+X`)  
- `wc` â€“ count lines/words/bytes (`wc -l`, `wc -w`)  
- `|` (pipe) â€“ pass output from one command to another

#### ðŸ“„ Example Practice (run these in a terminal)
```bash
# create folder and file
mkdir -p devops_day2
cd devops_day2
nano day2_practice.txt    # paste/enter the sample content, save & exit

# view and inspect
cat day2_practice.txt
less day2_practice.txt
head -n 5 day2_practice.txt
tail -n 5 day2_practice.txt

# follow updates live (open two terminals to test)
tail -f day2_practice.txt

# counts
wc day2_practice.txt
cat day2_practice.txt | wc -l



- Each folder contains `notes.txt`, `tasks.txt`, and scripts for that day.
- This README will be updated as I continue learning.
